Num images: 6000 (512x512px)

Purpose: Multipurpose

Description:
```
The Nomos-v2 dataset contains 6000 images of 512x512px each. The purpose of this dataset is to distill only the best images from the academic and community datasets. A total of 14 datasets were manually reviewed. Raw images were processed on rawtherapee using prebayer deconvolution, AMaZe and CAM16 on AP1 color space. Downsampling was done using Mitchell interpolation and post RL deconvolution.
The criteria for selection were:
High signal-to-noise ratio (low noise)
Diverse
Sharp (no motion blur, shallow DOF allowed)
Contains mixed and complex textures/shapes that cover most part of the image
```
